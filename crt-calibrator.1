.TH CRT-CALIBRATOR 1 CRT-CALIBRATOR
.SH NAME
crt-calibrator - CRT monitor calibrator utility for Linux VT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR crt-calibrator
.RI [ FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B crt-calibrator
is an interactive tool that guides you through calibrating your
CRT monitors. When done, the program will print gamma-ramp
information that is useful when setting the calibrations
automatically. If
.B FILE
is specified, this information is stored to that the file named
.BR FILE .
.PP
The program cannot be run from inside
.BR X ,
it is required that it is run from the
.BR Linux\ VT ,
otherwise known as the TTY.
.SH NOTES
.B crt-calibrator
should not be used to calibrate LCD (neither LED or TFT), plasma
monitors, or OLED. It should only be used to calibrate monitors
with nice gamma-curves, such as CRT monitors. Not monitors with
sigmoid-curves.
.SH RATIONALE
Few users have calibration hardware, and CRT monitors can be
sufficiently calibrated manually without them. However, before
.B crt-calibrator
the best way to calibrator CRT monitors was to have specialised
test images, with colour bars and samples. But this requires
expertise, the common user will know how to contruct these
images or the best procedure for applying the corrections. And
it is tedious if you do not find any interactive tool for change
changing the settings. The alternative why was to use test
pictures that relied on you deciding what looked most realistic
rather than the image itself telling you. But that's not all,
to my knowledge, this is actually the first program that runs
outside a display server.
